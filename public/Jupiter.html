      <h3>About Jupiter:</h3>
      <p>The fifth Planet from the Sun, Jupiter is the largest Planet in our Solar
        System. In fact, Jupiter is so large that its mass is two-and-half times
        greater than all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is
        the third brightest object in the sky, after Venus and our Moon. The planet
        is primarily made of hydrogen and helium but lacks a solid a surface like the
        other gas planets. The most distinctive feature of Jupiter is the 'great red
        spot', which is an violent storm.

     <h1>Mass, Size and Density:</h1>
     <p>The extreme size of Jupiter is seen in that its mass is 2.5 times greater
       than all the other Planets in the Solar System combined. However, although
       it is so much larger than Earth, due to its gaseos properties, it is significantly
       less dense than Earth, yet has a volume of approx 1,321 Earths and a radius one 10th
       of the Suns. A 'Jupiter Mass' is now a unit used to describe the size of other celestrial
       bodies like exoplanets (planets outside our Solar System). Researchers suggest that if
       Jupiter had any more mass it would srink as its interior compresses under the intense pressure.
       If this process was to continue, Jupiter would undergo 'stellar ignition', where a celestrial body
       ignites into a Star due to its intense pressure and compressed interior.
     </p>

     <ul>
       <li>Recent estimates suggest that Jupiter would need to be approximately
         75times larger to undergo 'stellar ignition'. Although the smallest Star
         is only 30% larger than Jupiter.
       </li>
       <li>Jupiter releases more heat than it absorbs from the Sun</li>
       <li>Jupiterâ€™s moon Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system.</li>
     </ul>

     <h1>Interaction with the Solar System:</h1>
     <p>The extreme size of Jupiter means that its gravitational influence has helped
       form some of the features of the Solar System. In fact, all other planets in our
       Solar System, excluding Mercury, are closer to Jupiters orbital plane than they
       are the Suns equitorial plane. The extreme size also means that the center of
       gravity by which the Planet orbits the Sun lies just above the Suns surface. Jupiter
       is the only Planet in the Solar System where this is true.

     <h1>The Great Red Spot</h1>
     <p>The most well known feature of Jupiter is the Great Red Spot. This is in fact a
       rapid storm that is larger than Earth itself. Researchers know that this storm
       has existed from atleast 1831, and possibly as early as 1665. This storms abnormal
       size means it has a complete rotation every 6 days. Although research has suggested
       that the storm is a stable permanent feature of Jupiter, the size has reduced significantly
       since it was discovered; leading some researchers to believe it will eventually cease to exist.
       The storm was first identified to be approx 25,500 miles across and last observations have measured
       the storm at approx 10,160 miles across. Showing more than a 50% reduction in size. However, this is
       not the only storm present on Jupiter. The white and brown overs are also lesser storms that have not
       be named.
      </p>
     <h2>Facts about Jupiter:</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>The lesser, white and brown, storms on Jupiter can last a few hours or even centuries</li>
         <li>The ancient Babylonians (approx 7th-8th century) were the first to record observation of Jupiter</li>
         <li>Jupiter also has a 'Great White Spot' that is larger than its Red counterpart but is less distinctive</li>

     <h1>Exploration: </h1>
     <p>Since 1973 there have been a number of SpaceCraft sent to study Jupiter and its moons. The first
        to be successful was the 'Pioneer 10' which sent back the first clear images of the Planet. In order
        to reduce the amount of energy, and therefore cost, to reach Jupiter, most probes use 'Gravity assist'
        to increase the speed and 'slingshot' the spacecraft with the Planets gravity. However, this increase the
        duration of the mission as the SpaceCraft takes a longer route to intercept and slingshot with other planets.
     </p>
 <h2>Past, Present and Future missions to Jupiter:</h2>
 <ul>
   <li>The Galileo spacecraft was the first to orbit Jupiter when it arrived in December 7, 1995. It orbited the
   Planet for seven years collecting data on its properties and its moons before parachuting into the planets atmosphere
 to collect and send back as much data as possible before the signal was lost and the probe would be vaporised.
</li>
 <li>Juno is an ongoing mission by NASA which arrived at Jupiter on July 4, 2016 and is expected to orbit the Planet 37 times
   over the next few months, collecting data on the Planets environment and moons.
 </li>
 <li>The Jupiter Icy Moon Exploorer (JUICE) is the next planned mission in 2022, and will be followed the the 'Europa Clippper' in 2025</li>
