      <h2>The International Space Station</h2>
      <p>The only method by which astronauts currently live in space over long
        durations is via the international space-station (ISS). This is deemed the
        first ever 'habital artificial satellite' positioned in low Earth orbit. In
        order to construct this station, the first component arrived in orbit during
        1988. However, the first long-term residents arrived in the year 2000. Since
        then, 220 people from 17 different countries have visited the ISS. The first
        crew consisited of 3 astronauts from America, Ukraine and Russia, although
        currently the ISS is capable of holding a max crew number of 6 occupants. Since
        initial habitation in 2000, the ISS has always had residents living aboard. This
        means individuals were living aboard the station before its construction was completed
        in 2011 when the last pressured module was attached. However, in order to improve
        safety, an inflatable space habitat was fitted in 2016. In total the station is
        expected to function until 2030.
      </p>
      <h3>Purpose of the ISS:</h3>
      <p>The ISS is designed to be a microgravity-based research centre located in space.
        The crew aboard this station coduct research in various fields of Biology, Physics,
        astronomy and many more. The station also allows testing of spacecraft systems which
        will be used to travel to the moon and to distant planets such as Mars. These consistent
        trips to and from the ISS are made possible by use of its engines to perform a range of
        manouvers which ensure it stays within an orbital altitude of 205 and 270 miles. These
        manouvers are also necessary because the ISS is travelling at an extreme speed of approx
        7.66 km/s, allowing it to orbit the Earth every 92 minutes, which equates to 15.5 orbits
        per day.
      </p>
      <h3>Who Owns the ISS:</h3>
      <p> The ISS was made possible by the collaboration of many companies in America (NASA),
        Canada(CSA), Europe(ESA) and many more. The ISS is both owned and managed all these
        individuals and is possible due to 'intergovernmental treaties and agreements'. However,
        the station itself is divided into two main segments. The Russian orbital segment and
        the United States Orbital Segment, but are occupied by individuals from many regions.

      <h3>Health and Safety for the Crew:</h3>
      <p>The main assess conducted to assess astronaut health aboard the ISS was the recent
        twin study. During this study, one (astronaut) twin spent a year on Earth, while the
        other spent a year on the ISS. After a multitude of both neuropsychological and physical
        tests, findings demonstrated several changes to areas such as DNA alteration and cognition
        when comparing one twin with the other. In fact, there are various health concerns for both
        living aboard the ISS, and long-term habitation in space all togther.
        </p>
        <h4>Radiation:</h4>
        <p>Given that the ISS is not positioned a vast distance away from Earth, the magnetic field of
          our planet typically protects it from the harsh environment of space. For example, it usually
          deflects solar wind around the Earth and ISS. However, solar wind is still a danger to the crew
          who may only recieve a few minutes warning before impact. This incident occured in 2005 when the
          crew was hit by a proton storm from solar wind. In order to maximise safety, they took shelter in
          a region of the Russian orbital segment which is heavily guarded and designed for this purpose.

          <h2>Stress: </h2>
          <p>Extensive research into factors that hinder performance on the ISS has found that psychosocial
            stressors were among the highest factors to negatively effect crew members and subsequently reduce
            morale and performance. In fact, one of the crew members aboard the salyut 6 wrote in his journal
            that "All the conditions necessary for murder are met if you shut two men in a cabin measuring 18
            feet by 20 and leave them together for two months". NASA continues to design and implement new measures
            to reduce psychosocial stress of astronauts aboard the space staion. This is especially needed if long
            term flights are to take place to planets such as Mars.
