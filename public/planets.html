      <h2>About Planets</h2>
      <p>A planet is a celestrial body which moves in an eliptical orbit around a Star.
        This object is large enough to become rounded by its own gravity, but is not large
        enough to cause thermoneuclear fusion, and subsequently ignite into a Star. In fact,
        there are more planets than Stars in our galaxy, with a current count of eight planets
        in our own Solar System. While the environments of these plants range from being made up
        of gas, to having temperatures well below freezing, or well above the melting point of most
        of our current metals, it remains debatable about how large a celestrial body has to be, in
        order to be classified as a planet.
    </p>
    <p>A variety of space agencies, most notably NASA and Spacex, have set their sights on the planet
       Mars, as the first destination for a manned mission to another planet. This is because among all
       the plants in our solar System, Mars is the closest to Earth in both distance (with the exception
       of venus), and environmental/climactic features. It is therefore believed to be our best opportunity
       for colonisation.

   <h2>PLANETS OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM</h2>
   <p>The Solar System is the gravitationally bound planetary system of the Sun and
   the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of the objects that
   orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets, with the remainder
   being smaller objects, such as the five dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies</p>

         <h1>EXOPLANETS: EXTRASOLAR PLANETS</h1>
       </div>
       <div class="board">
         <h2>What are Exoplanets:</h2>
         <p>These are planets outside of our solar system which orbit Stars other
           than our own. Some of these planets contain atmospheres that are thought
           to support life. This is usually predicted when the planet orbits at a
           distance from its Star that allows liquid water to exist in a similar condition to our own.
         </p>
          </div>
          <div class="board">
            <h2>How are Exoplanets found:</h2>
            <p>The most common method of searching for Extrasolar planet around a Star
              is to identify whether the Star has a 'Wobbly' orbit. This phenomenon occurs
              when a planet orbits a star because its gravitational influence prevents the
              star from orbiting perfectly along its centre. However, this method is primarily used
              to detect planets the size of Jupiter. Those the size of Earth have little influence on the
              Stars orbit, so produce only a minor 'wobble'.</p>
             </div>
             <div class="board">
               <h2>How many Exoplanets:</h2>
               <p>As of March 2019, a total of 4016 exoplanets have been successfully identified, most of
                 which were discovered by the Kepler Telescope. However, not all of these planets are
                 thought to be Earth-like. Many of them likely have conditions that are too extreme to
                 support life, especially that of Human colonisation.

     <div class="ExoImages">
       <img src="../images/kepler-16.jpg" alt=""></img>
       <div class="Innerboard">
         <p>Name: Kepler-16b</p>
         <p>Year Of Discovery: 15th September 2011</p>
         <p>Information: Kepler-16b is a planet with a similar mass to Saturn. The planet consists of
            half gas and half rock and ice. Kepler-16b was the first planet to be identified as 'circumbinary',
            in that it orbits not one, but two Stars. This Binary Star system was first discovered by NASAs Kepler
            spacecraft.

       <img src="../images/proxima-b.jpg" alt=""></img>
       <div class="Innerboard">
         <p>Name: Proxima-centuri-b</p>
         <p>Date Of Discovery: 26th August 2016</p>
         <p>Information: Proxima-b is an exoplanet that orbits the Star proxmia Centuri. Due to the Stars small size
           relative to others, it is termed a 'red dwarf' Star. Proxmia-b is thought to orbit in the 'habital zone'
           of its Star, meaning it is likely at a distance that could support life. Upon discovery, it was identified
           as the closet exoplanet to our solar system, with a distance of 4.24 light years from Earth.

     <div class="ExoImages">
       <img src="../images/gliese-581c.jpg" alt=""></img>
       <div class="Innerboard">
         <p>Name: Gliese-581c</p>
         <p>Date Of Discovery: 4th April 2007</p>
         <p>Information: Gliese-581c is an exoplanet with a mass 5.5 times of Earth, and is therefore classified as a
           super Earth. The notability of this planet is that its the only Earth-like planet in its Star system. Its
           temperature is within ranges thought to allow liquid water. However, further research has suggested the
           existence of life or the possiblity for human colonisation is unlikely. This is because the planet is tidally
           locked (also faces the same direction to the star), and so the best chance of life surviving would be in the
           'Terminator zone'; an area on the planet that presents the division between light and dark.

         <p>Name: Kepler-22b</p>
         <p>Date Of Discovery: 5th December 2011</p>
         <p>Information: Roughly twice the size of Earth, Kepler-22b is thought to be an oceanic planet, existing within the
           habital zone of its host Star Kepler-22, which is slightly smaller and cooler than our own sun. However, given that
           Kepler orbits slightly closer to its Star than the Earth does the sun, it has been estaimted as hight as 95% chance
           that the planet is within the empirical habital zone.
