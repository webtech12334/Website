      <h3>About Saturn:</h3>
      <p>The sixth Planet from the Sun, Saturn is the second largest Planet is
      our solar system, after Jupiter. Saturn is characterised as a 'gas giant'
    and has a radius roughly nine times that of Earth. Although much less dense
  than Earth (approx by one eigth), it is over 95 times larger. Saturns most unique
feature is its surrounding rings of rock.</p>

      <h3>General Information:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Number of moons: 62 confirmed</li>
        <li>Date Of Discovery: 1610 first observed</li>
        <li>Rotation Period: 10hrs</li>
        <li>Planetary Type: Ice Giant</li>

        <li>Name: Derived from the Roman god of agriculture</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Enviromental/Climactic features:</h2>
      <p>The pale yellow colour of Saturn is likely due to the high concentration
        of ammonia crystals in the upper atmosphere. Saturn also has extremely fast
        winds that can reach 1100mph. Although faster than those on Jupiter, these
        are still slower than winds on Neptune. These high winds are also characteristic
        of absence of a definitive surface (its made of mainly gas), although it has a solid core.
      </p>

        <h2>Saturn Facts:</h2>
        <li>Saturns largest moon Titan is larger than the Planet Mercury</li>
        <li>Four SpaceCraft have visited Saturn</li>
        <li>Saturn is the flattest of the eight Planets</li>
        <li>Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water (approx 30% less).
        Although the core is much more dense</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="ReducedBoard">
      <h2>Planetary Rings:</h2>
      <p> The visually unique feature of Saturns rings makes likely makes its the most identifiable planet
        of our Solar System. These rings have an average thickness of around 20 meters (66ft). They are made
        mainly of ice and vary in size from that of dust, to around 10 meters. Despite the extreme visability
        of Saturns rings, it is not the only planet with ring features. The other gas giants (Jupiter, Neptune and
        Uranus) also have rings, but are smaller and so less visable.
      </p>
      <h2>The origin of Saturns Rings: Two main theories</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>One Theory suggests that the rings orginate from a destroyed moon of Saturn</li>
        <li>The second suggest they are left over from the orginal material that formed Saturn</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Exploration:</h2>
      <p>A total of four SpaceCraft have visited and studied Saturn. The first flyby was made by Pioneer 11
        in 1979 when it took images of the Planet and its moons, although resolution was so low that surface
        detail could not be identified. Voyager 2 then flew by in November 1980 and sent back the first high
        resolution images of the Planet, its moons and rings, allowing surface detail to be studied. Voyager 2
        followed in August 1981 and sent back closer images of Saturn, before heading to Uranus. The most recent
        mission was that of the 'Cassiniâ€“Huygens' spacecraft. This probe entered saturns orbit in 2004 and performed
        close flybys of its moons. Cassini then captured images of Saturns largest moon 'Titan' and discovered the
        presence of large lakes, coastlines and numerous islands and mountains. Cassini has since made many other discoveries
        of Saturns moons and environmental conditions.
      </p>
      <h2>Possible Future Missions:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Although no detailed plans have been constructed, NASA has put forward ideas of future missions using
          probes to perfom atmospheric entry on Saturn, and study the moons Titan and Enceladus for possible colonisation
        </li>
      </ul>
