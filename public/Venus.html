      <h3>About Venus:</h3>
      <p>The second planet from the sun, Venus is a similar size
        to Earth. Venus has the longest Rotation period in our
        solar system, and rotates in the opposite direction to most
        other planets. As a result, the sun rises in the west and sets
        in the East (Opposite to Earth). Venus has no moons and is the
        second brightest object in the space, after the moon.

     <h1>Enviromental/Climactic Features:</h1>
     <p>Although sometimes referred to as Earths 'siser' planet due to
       similar size and distance from the sun, venus has a very dense
       atmosphere compared to Earths (over 96% CO2). The atmospheric
       pressure is approximately the same as that found 3000ft underwater
       on Earth. Venus is by far the hottest planet in the solar system,
       despite Mercury being closer to the Sun, with an average surface
       temperature of 462 degrees celcius (735 Kelvin). These extreme
       temperatures are due to the much thicker atmosphere compared to
       Mercury and Earth, allowing the temperature to increase by a
       greenhouse effect. The surface is therefore very dry with no liquid
       water and highly populated with volcanos.
     </p>

     <ul>
       <li>Venus surface is obsurced by thick clouds of sulphuric acid, making
         visibility from space impossible.
       </li>
       <li>The temperature of Venus is higher than that used for sterilisation</li>
       <li>The surface of Venus is Isothermal: It retains the same temperature
         on both day and night sides, and between the equator and poles.
       </li>
       <li>Venus also tilts on its axis much less than Earth, also contributing
       to the constant temperature.
     </li>
     <li>Although debatable, it is thought the clouds of Venus still may be
     able to produce lighting.
   </li>
   <li>The highest point on Venus (Maxwell Montes) has the coolest temperature of
   approximately 380 degrees celcius. </li>

     <h1>Habitability and Life:</h1>
     <p>The speculation that life existed on Venus decreased significantly in the
       early 1960s when spacecraft first began studying the harsh atmosphere and
       realised that conditions were likely far too extreme to support life. For
       example, a surface temperature of 460 degrees celcius (735K), an atmospheric
       pressure ninety times that of Earths, and the global impact of the greenhouse
       effect makes water-based life highly unlikely. However, researchers speculate
       that it is possible that microorganisms adjusted to the extreme temperatures
       may live in the cooler and more acidic higher regions of Venus.

     <h1>Observation: Morning Star and Evening Star</h1>
     <p>When observed by the naked eye, Venus appears as a white point in the
     sky that is brighter than any other Star or Planet except the Sun and Moon.
     Every 584days, Venus overtakes the Earth in its orbit around the Sun. This
     changes it from the "Evening Star" which is visible after Sunset, to the
     "Morning Star", which is visible before sunrise.</p>
     <h2>Facts about Venuses Observation:</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>Venuses bright nature means many have reported it as an "unidentified
         flying object"</li>
         <li>When Venus reaches maximum elongation, and becomes its brightest,
         Venus can be seen in dark skies long after Sunset</li>
         <li>Venus produces a so-called 'ashen light' (a weak illumination on
           its dark side), of which was first observed in 1643. This long standing
         mystery has been speculated to be because of electrical activity in Venuses
       atmosphere, but could also be illusory due to the observation of a bright,
     crescent shaped object</li>
     </ul>

     <h1>Exploration: Soviet Venra and Mariner 2</h1>
     <p>The first robotic space probe mission to any planet was performed by the
     the Soviet Venra in 1961. This lauched towards Venus and was followed by the
   United States Mariner 2 in 1962. The Mariner 2 marked the first successful
   interplanatery mission with the probe passing just over 21,000 miles above the
 surface, collecting data about Venuses atmosphere.</p>
 <h2>Early missions to Venus</h2>
 <ul>
   <li>Soviet Venra 4 (18th October 1967): Entered the atmosphere of Venus and
   discovered that the surface temperature was much hotter than Mariner 2 predicted,
 and the atmosphere much more dense</li>
   <li>Mariner 10 (1974): Flew pass Venus on the way to Mercury and captured
   ultraviolet photographs of extreme wind speeds</li>
   <li>Soviet Venra 9 and 10 (1975): Transmitted the first black and white images
   of the surface of Venus</li>
   <li>Soviet Venra 13 and 14 (1982): The first color images of the surface were
   obtained</li>
