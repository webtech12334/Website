      <h3>Space Flight</h3>
      <p>Multiple companies around the globe are racing to place the first
        man on Mars. The most notable exception includes Spacex, which aims
        to launch as soon as 2024, with its Techologically advanced SpaceCraft
        'Starship'.

      <h3>Conquer Size With Quantity</h3>
      <p>The new Horizons Telescope is an international collaboration with the
        aim of taking the first ever picture of a black hole. However, in order
        to capture enough light for this image, NASA would require a Telescope
        the size of Planet Earth! This barrier is overcome by having a total of 12
        very large Telescopes positioned at various locations around the globe, all
        operating in synchrony.

      <h3>Beyond our solar system:</h3>
      <p>There exist many strange phenomena outside of our immediate solar system
        which many researchers are still unable to fully understand. Amomg others,
        examples include black holes and the nature of dark matter. Although black
        holes have been physically observed, the presence of dark matter is still a
        theoretical notion.
