    <h2>Space Exploration: Manned Missions</h2>
    <p>Staring from the mid-20th century there has been a large scale attempt to
      first get a man into space, and then aboard over celestrial objects such as
      the moon. This was termed the 'space race'. Currently, the falcon heavy,
      produced by SpaceX, is the most powerful spacecraft in existence today. However,
      the Falcon heavy is miniscal in comparison to the Saturn V (the vehicle that
      took man to the moon). Despite this, Falcon heavy is currently leading in power
      by a factor of 2. There are several other spacecraft which have lead man into
      space. The most famous is likey the space shuttle. This partially re-usable spacecraft
      was first launched in 1981, and performed 135 missions before retirement in 2011.

    <h2>Saturn V:</h2>

    <div class="TextBoard">
      <p> The Saturn V was designed by NASA and used between 1967 and 1971. To-date,
          the Saturn V is still the most powerful rocket to have ever existed. It was
          an expendable rocket which was developed to be used in the Apollo program, and
          was subsequently used to lift all the equipment for the Lunar mission. It was
          later used to launch skylab, the first American space-station. In total, Saturn
          V launched 13 times from the Kennedy space station, and has never lost any crew
          or payload. It is therefore the only rocket to have launched man beyond low Earth
          orbit.
      </p>
      <h3>Saturn V Technology:</h3>
      <p>Once the Apollo spacecraft was fitted ontop of the Saturn V rocket, it stood at
        363 ft tall and was 33 ft in diamter. Once the rocket was fully fueled in weighed
        approximately 6.5 million lbs, and was capable of carrying of payload of 261,000 lbs
        into low Earth orbit. Upon launch it was capable of sending 90,000 lbs to the lunar surface.
        Later upgrades increased this capacity significantly, and modern-day rockets are unable
        to launch such a payload, with the Falcon heavy leading with 141,000 lbs capacity.

    <h2>SpaceX: Dragon Capsule</h2>
    <p>SpaceX has also developed a SpaceCraft-like-Capsule known as Dragon. The role of this
       craft is to carry both people and cargo to various orbital destinations. The most common
       of which is the international space-station. One main advantage is that it is able to return
       significant amounts of cargo from these destinations back to Earth. Currently, it is the only
       spacecraft capable of doing this. The Dragon capsule is also capable of docking to the international
       space station autonomously, and is the first American SpaceCraft to have done this in March 2019. The
       re-usable capsule has a capacity of 7 passengers and 3,307 kilograms (7,291 lb) of cargo. It primarily
       lands using parachutes due to the inability of proving the safety of landing using boosters with passengers,
       but in theory, in the event the parachutes do not deploy, the spacecraft could still land with boosters as this
       is what it was designed for originally.

    <h2>Falcon Heavy: </h2>
    <p>The Falcon Heavy is a partially re-usable SpaceCraft and is derived from the individual Falcon 9
      boosters. Not only does Falcon heavy succedd in utilising re-usable parts, but its capable of lifting
      more than double the payload of its closest competition (Delta IV Heavy), for one-third of the cost.
      This is primarily becuase of its re-usable Falcon 9 boosters. The three Falcon 9 boosters that launch
      this spacecraft consist of 27 total Merlin engines and produces more than 5 million pounds of thrust
      at lift of, which is roughly eighteen 747 airplanes.

    <div class="TextBoardRight">
      <p>The Falcon heavy design is based off the individual falcon 9 fuselage and engines.
         However, the launch of Falcon heavy was delayed due to the delay of Falcon 9, consisting
         of several failed test-runs and crashes with the boosters. This meant that the first flight
         was in Feburary 2018 and was a success on the first run. The first static fire test was conducted
         in 2017 which assessed all three first stage flight cores. Following these tests, the falcon heavy
         carried its first significant payload, a Tesla roadstar car, into space as proof of its ability to
         successfully deliver cargo into low earth orbit. To date, the Tesla remains in space.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="TextBoardRight">
      <p>The Falcon heavy was designed we a re-inforced centre core which would be capable of withstanding the
        force produced by 3 Falcon 9 boosters, and a total of 27 Merlin engines. Once lift off has been a success,
        the boosters all eventually disengage from the main rocket, and land on individually allocated landing pads.
        This allows the boosters to be re-used and is the primary reason by which the Falcon heavy is so much cheaper
        to construct, and deliver payload into space than its nearest competition. Despite this, it remains more powerful
        than its closest competition by a factor of 2.

    <p>The Saturn V Engines are known as F-1 and were developed in the United States
      in 1950. In total, five F-1 engines were used on Saturn V to launch the Apollo
      programs. To date, the F-1 remains the most powerful 'singl combustion chamber
      liquid-propellant' rocket engine to have ever existed. The engine uses kerosene
      as fuel and produced over 1.5 million lbs of thrust, meaning that each F-1 engine
      had more thrust than three space shuttle main engines combined.
