        <h3>About Neptune:</h3>
        <p>The eigth planet from the Sun, Neptune is the furthest planetary body
          in our Solar System. Neptune is 17 times larger than Earth, and therefore
          slightly bigger than its neighbour Uranus. The greater distance of Neptune
          means that it orbits the Sun once every 164 years. This distance also means
          Neptune cannot be seen with the naked eye, and is therefore the only planet
          that was found by mathermatical predictions rather than (telescopic) observations.

        <h1>Enviromental/Climactic Features:</h1>
        <p>Although mostly hydrogen and Helium, researchers have found trace
          amounts of methane in Neptunes atmosphere. This methane results in the
          blue appearance of Neptune. The methane absorbs any red light that enters
          the atmosphere, and produces a red hue. However, the weather on the blue
          planet is another unique feature of Neptune. It is identified by extremely
          windly storms, where these winds can reach approx 1300mph (almost supersonic speed).
          These speeds are much greater at the cloud tops and most move in the opposite
          direction of the planets rotation. The amount of methane present at Neptunes
          equator is approx 10-100 times that present at its poles.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Neptune has a similar storm to venus termed the 'Great Dark Spot'
          </li>
          <li>The greater variation in Neptunes weather patterns is partly due
          to a higher internal temperature</li>
          <li>On the 11th July 2011, Neptune completed its first orbit since its
            discovery in 1846
          </li>
          <li>Neptunes orbit directly impacts the Kuiper belt (the icy ring at the
            edge of our solar system)
        </li>
        <li>The formation of the two ice giants, Neptune and Uranus, remains debatable although
          some theories have been suggested
      </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Planetary Rings and Observation:</h1>
        <h2>Rings:</h2>
        <p>Although not as large as Saturns, and therefore as visible, Neptune also
          has a planetary ring system. The content of these rings are icy rocks which
          researchers suggest are coated in carbon-based material, or silicates and
          results in a partial red hue. These Planetary rings were first detected in
          1968, and researchers have since suggested that some of these rings may be
          incomplete and have gaps.
        </p>
        <h2>Observation:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Observation has become slightly easy since Neptune brightend significantly between
            1980 and 2000.
          </li>
          <li>Despite this it is still to dim to be viewed by the naked eye, and other celestrial bodies
          such as Jupiter's Galilean moons are able to outshine it.</li>

          <li>If viewed from a Telescope or powerful bonoculos, Neptune will appear as a small
            blue disk.
          </li>
          <li>This far distance means most observatory analysis could not be done until the
            invention of the hubble Telescope and other very powerful ground based Telescopes.
        </li>
        <li>As a result, the first useful ground based observation was done in 1997 from Huwaii
      </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Storms: The Greate Dark Spot</h1>
        <p>The Great Dark Spot is an atyclonic storm present on Neptune, discovered in 1989 by
          NASAs Voyager 2 spacecraft. However, when observed 5 years later by the Hubble Telescope,
          this storm was no longer present, but was replaced by another storm in Neptunes northern
          Hemisphere. Another storm on Neptune termed 'Scooter' was also discovered in 1989 by Voyager
          2, as it was seen moving at faster speeds than estimated for the Great Dark Spot. Additionally,
          the small dark spot, another cyclonic storm, was discovered by Voyager 2, and although it
          initially seemed dark, as the spacecraft approached the planet it a bright core developed and
          the probe recieved images of the phenomenon that can be seen in most high resolution photographs.

        <h1>Exploration: Voyager 2</h1>
        <p>Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune. As a result of the far distance, signals
          from the SpaceCraft required 246mins to reach Earth. This meant that most operations performed by the
          spacecraft were pre-loaded as mission control would be unable to instruct it from such a distance. Therefore,
          given that Neptune was the last planet that the SpaceCraft could visit, NASA also performed a flyby close to its
          moons, regardless of what the consequences were to its trajectory. No other missions to Neptune have been conducted
          since, but the next mission termed the 'Flag ship orbital mission' is thought to take place in the late 2020s or early
          2030s.
