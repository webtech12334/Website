      <h3>About Mercury:</h3>
      <p>The smallest planet in the solar system, Mercury is the closest to the
        Sun. Unlike Earth, Mercury completes its orbit around the Sun in 87.97 days,
        making it the shortest orbital period of all planets.

      <h2>Enviroment,Climate and the Surface</h2>
      <p>
        At the most extreme places on Mercury, the surface experiences temperatures
        from -173 to 427 degress celcius; with the temperature at the poles never
        rasing above 180 degrees celcius because of the absence of an atmosphere.
        Despite the extreme temperatures, astronomers believe that ice still exists
        on Mercury in areas that never come into direct contact with the sunlight,
        so experience more consistently low temperatures that anywhere else. Given
        that ice also has high radar relectivity, researchers have seen this effect
        when testing radar at the poles of Mercury, suggesting the presence of ice
        is the most likely cause. Although Mercury doesnt have an atmosphere, it does
        have an exosphere, which is comprised of many atoms supplied and removed off the
        surface by solar wind from the Sun. This exophere is made up mainly of hydrogen,
        sodium, helium, pottasium and oxygen.

      <ul>
        <li>Mercury is the second most dense planet in the solar system (after Earth)</li>
        <li>Mercury's core occupies approximately 55% of its volume, compared to 17% on Earth (dense core)</li>
        <li>Mercur's core has more iron content that any other planet in the solar system</li>

      <h2>Habitability and Presence of life</h2>
      <p> Given the extreme conditions on Mercury, most researchers believe the planet
        is not capable of supporting life. The solar radiation and high temperatures are
        likely to extreme for life to adapt to. The lack of atmosphere  and oceans presents
        further environmental conditions that would prove difficult for life to adapt to. As
        a result, Mercury presents no environmental benefit for attempted colonisation by humans.

      <h2>Interesting facts about Mercury</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It is the smallest planet, approximately the size of continental United States (slightly bigger than our moon)</li>
        <li>An asteriod hit Mercury (approx 60miles wide), forming a crater that could fit Texas inside (Caloris Basin)</li>
        <li>NASAs 'Messenger' probe has mapped the whole of Mercury (made possible by its small size)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Exploration:</h2>
      <p>There is little interest among space agencies for exploring Mercury (it is the least explored of the inner planets).
        Despite this, there has been some developments. As of 2015, only the 'MESSENGER' and 'Mariner 10' probes have had missions
        to map explore the Planet. This exploration is made more difficult by the increased speed required to reach the planet and
        its proximity to the Sun, where the Stars gravity pulls on any orbiting object. The Mariner 10 mission detected the magnetic
        field of Mercury, which is similar to Earths. The visual data from this probe also showed the high number of craters on Mercury.
        The 'MESSENGER' probe had several objects: characterise the chemical composition of the planet, determine the size and state of
        the core, study Mercury's exophere etc.
      </p>
      <h2>Ongoing Missions:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>BepiColombo: This mission will use two probes to answer several questions such as 'is Mercury tectocnically active today',
        'Why does such a small planet possess an intrinsic magnetic field, while Venus, Mars and the Moon do not have any' etc.</li>
