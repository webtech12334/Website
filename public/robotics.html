     <h3>Robotics in Space:</h3>
     <p>In our current technological period, robotics is the primary
        mechanism by which we can perform space exploration. This is because
        they are not as susceptible to the harsh environments of space as
        their human counterparts. We are able to send them to explore other planets
        through which they return data. This may involve simply orbiting the planet,
        and possibly landing on their surface. The most notable examples include the
        rovers, landers and orbiters which study Mars and its atmosphere.
       </p>

     <h3>Common examples: </h3>
     <ul>
       <li>New Horizons: Pluto</li>
       <li>Galileo probe: Jupiter</li>
       <li>Mars Rover Opportunity</li>

      <h2>Mars Exploration: Rovers</h2>
      <p>The Mars Rovers are the major workhorse for modern-day Mars exploration.
         Not only do they provide data on the chemical composition of Mar's surface,
         they also return rather detailed images, allowing researchers to view the surface
         of the Red world. Initially, these images could only be viewed in black and white,
         but overtime, color images were produced allowing the first glimps on the surface of
         Mars. Coupled with six wheels and greater size and capability, these exploratory
         machines have given NASA much more depth of information compared to immobile devices.

      <h3>First Mars Rover: Sojourner</h3>
      <img src="./images/soj.jpg" alt="Image cannot be displayed"></img>
      <div class="TextBoard">
      <p> The first Mars Rover, Sojourner, was named after the abolitionist and early womens
        rights activist Sojourner Truth. It landed on Mars in 1977 when it touched down in Ares
        Villis; thought to be an ancient flood plain on Mars. This would allow it to easily move
        around and explore the rocky surface while studying the chemical composition to signs of
        ancient water. In comparsion to current Rovers, Sojourner was very small. Its dimensions
        are of 66cm long, 48cm wide and 30cm tall. Despite this, like it modern counterparts,
        Sojourner had 6 wheels which worked independently so if one became stuck in mud, the remaining
        5 could work to power the the Rover out. Its max speed was 0.015mph.

       <h3>Future Rovers: </h3>
     <p> The exploration of Mars will continue with a series of similar, but much improved Mars rovers.
         The closest of which is the 'Mars2020 rover', a near twin of Curiosity but fitted with many
         improvements. It will explore an area known as 'Jezero Crater', where it will collect many samples
         that will eventually be picked up and brought back to Earth. The estimated launch date is July or
         August 2020, and is scheduled to arrive at Mars in 2021. The European space agency will also launch a
         rover known as 'ExoMars 2020/Franklin', named after the British scientist Rosalind Franklin. The Franklin
         rover will be fitted with a drill capable of penetrating 6 feet beneath the Martian surface. This will allow
         it to perform additional searches for signs of life on Mars.

     <h2>Cassini–Huygens: Exploration of Saturn </h2>
   <p> Launched in 1997, the Cassini spacecraft was active for almost 20 years, and spent 13 of those years orbiting
       Saturn to study the planet and its system since its arrival in 2004. Through such study, Cassini has allowed us
       to explore worlds where methane rivers run and lead into methane-based seas. It has allowed researchers to explore
       worlds where jets of ice and gas propel material into space from a liquid ocean that may be capable of supporting
       life. Cassini carried the Huygens probe to Saturn. However, after so many years of service, Cassini exhauted its
       fuel supply, and in order to protect the icy moons of Saturn from contamination as its possible they support life,
       Cassini was instructed to dive into the atmosphere of Saturn and return as much data as possible before being destroyed.
   </p>

    <h3>Features of Cassini and Huygens</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cassini carried instruments for Optical Remote Sensing which allowed it to
        study Saturn and its moon on the electromagentic spectrum.
      </li>
      <li>It also carried equipment capable of studying fields, particles and waves.
      Specifically, this allowed Cassani to study the dust, plasma and magnetic fields
      of Saturn.
    </li>
    <li>Cassani was also capable of microwave Remote sensing, where it used radiowaves to
        map the atmosphere. This allowed determination of the size of moons, and individual
        ring components.
    </li>
    <li>Once Cassani deployed the Huygens probe, it landed on Titan after a decent of approx
      2hrs, and lasted around 72 minutes. This is the first, and only landing in our outer
      solar system.
    </li>
    <li>Cassani had two attenas, one high-gain and one low-gain, which it used to communicate
      with Earth
    </li>
    <li>In total, Cassani had 12 instruments, while Huygens had 6.
    </li>
    </ul>

     <p> The exploration is space is primarily manned by robotic spacecraft. There is an increasinly
       wider breadth of machinary that is being set into the depths of space. In fact, the Voyager 1
       spacecraft is the furthest object that humanity has launched. However, Voyager 1s declining
       power supply means it will stop transmitting data by 2025, and so information will be recieved
       from that distant location. Launched in 1977, Voyager 1s power supply is only 470 watts. Other
       robotic spacecraft such as Galileo have allowed us to study Jupiter, its system and therefore its
       moons. As technology continues to advance, manned missions to distant planets will become easier,
       but in our current time of technological progress, robotic spacecraft lead the way.
