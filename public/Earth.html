         <h3>About Earth:</h3>
         <p>The third Planet from the Sun, Earth is the only known object in our
            Universe which harbours life. According to most scientific research, Earth formed
            around 4.5 billion years ago, and has only one natural satellite known simply
            as the moon. The gravitational and magnectic fields of Earth interact directly with
            other celestrial bodies like the moon and Sun.

      <h1>Enviromental/Climactic Features:</h1>
      <p>The ocean tides on Earth are largely controlled by the gravitational Interaction
        between the Earth and moon. This also allows the Earth to stabalise its orientation on
        its axis, and gradurally slow in rotation. Although Earth is not the largest planet in
        our Solar System, it is the densest planet, and is the largest of all the Terestrial
        planets (Mars, Venus, Mercury and Earth).
